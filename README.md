# Bike-Rental

This was a project assigned by my professor for my statistical learning and data science course and our assignment was that we had been hired by the city to help better understand bike rental demand. The focus of the assignment was less focused on the accuracy of the model (although it was still a part of the grading) but to dive deep into the data and try to understand which predictors could be used to help predict the bike supply for a day given environmental data.
